  # The CPU resource in millicores (1/1000 of a core) to allocate to each instance.
  # For a typical Next.js app, a value between 0.5 and 1 cores (500-1000 millicores) is a good starting point.
  cpu: 1

  # The amount of memory in MiB to allocate to each instance.
  # For a typical Next.js app, 512MiB or 1024MiB is a reasonable start.
  memoryMiB: 512

  # The maximum number of instances to run.
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 10

  # The minimum number of instances to keep running at all times.
  # This can help reduce cold starts.

# Concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent requests
